# shiny_substance_use_winnipeg

This project is an interactive R Shiny dashboard that visualizes open data from the City of Winnipeg related to substance use incidents and naloxone administration.

The dashboard brings together two public datasets to explore:

- Time trends of incidents
- Demographic patterns (age, gender)
- Most involved substances
- Naloxone usage patterns
- An interactive map of harm reduction services
- A full “About” page with project context and data caveats

The app is modular, fully documented, and designed for clarity, transparency, and potential expansion into broader public health contexts.
